# 350-YARA-Rules
This repo is made to store the YARA rules we make for FOR-350 Malware Analysis.

## Making Additions
Please contact RedHare-Exe to commit a new rule to the repo. This methodology may be updated later.

### RedHare's Commit Method
When a new rule is made, it's added in a direct commit to main, under `/main/[labName]/[lab]/`.

This may be updated in the future to be a PR instead.
